- Design button as I wish

* **IMPORTANT** When button is clicked change text color and when the next button is clicked return the color of the previous button back to normal.
  - 1 Get all the buttons.
  - 2 Loop through them and set a color on click on all the buttons
  - 3 Get individual buttons and onclick change the colors of the others back to nromal.

## setup start stop watch

- Onclick of the stop/start button the timer should start from seconds then minutes then hours basicly increment the timer and on click again stop the timer

- Set a reset button that clears all the recorded time and start/stop button

- Set record time Button and a playground for the recorded time to be registered.
